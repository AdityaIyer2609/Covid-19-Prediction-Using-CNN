# Covid-19-Prediction-Using-CNN
Convolution Neural Network to predict Covid-19. This is a CNN model which predicts whether you have Healthy or you have Coronavirus or you have Pneumonia. I implemented CNN from Scratch and I implemented VGG-16 architecture. This model takes your CT scan report as input and will tell you the result. This Convolutional layer Connects to DeepNeuralNetwork.  I found this image dataset(CT scan of patients) online and trained the model for 70 epochs using Softmax function in the output layer. If I had got a much more large image dataset(CT scan of patients) then I could have increased the accuracy a bit more. This model has the potential to become a breakthrough invention in the field of medical industry.
